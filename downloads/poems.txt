Oh love me would you please
Do notice and see
The contents of my longings
For you a radiant of a being !

Soon should your eyes witness 
That under your beauty’s presence
A crude desire engulfs my every sense,
Because of a fire which flares
From your pair of eyes
Revealing a child like innocence
That I don't dare to possess

Because despite my obvious failings
Don’t choose to abandon me alone
Except leave, only tender words
Sung from your voice so sweet
So that I may dream 
while I live. 
Or die under your spell
And spend eternity having never seen 
To dare to speak of the pleasures
Which you had bestowed unto me
