I have heard of such names before,
As if in another life, a memory I am sure.
Who could have it been expect a girl so pure
Yet the sweetness of her name, whose image I cannot conjure.

I see the scenery between you and I
Amongst the natural decorations of the rosy kind.
Then you looked at me with your comforting eyes,
They reflected the colours of spring
Which couldn't contain the vibrancy of your mind.

Shamefully I confess I couldn't offer you any
But I did, I really did recognise your feelings
You're a free spirit searching and longing
And all that I could do was to accompany your journey
For I without gifts or passions like yours, 
Could only dream of one day rescuing you
From those torments into that of a hope secured.

Yet in another image, of younger years and youthful passions 
I had not known you then, but you had said you knew me before.
I wondered since when had I met a beauty like her 
And of a character so warm?

You told me,
“rest assured, my love for you would forever last,
into that of winter it would pass
without a warmth forgot,
I have heard of your soul’s silent whispers and your sleepful laugh
And I know when you had loved me then and now
So why do you still hide yourself as if I do not know your heart?”

Who was it that had said those words of comfort?
Had it been during childhood's hour or of a life long ago?
Either way, in memories pain now I do my daily strolls
On concrete walks, in a life so dull
Forgetting about a love so pure.
